## A look into the performance of the Australian cinema industry between 1980 and 2024.

For this project, I look at how the Australian cinema industry has changed between 1980 and 2024.

The data includes big picture performance metrics such as total admissions, gross box office, and admissions per capita. It also includes data relating to total theatres, screens and seats as well as the average ticket price per year.

This data has been compiled from Screen Australia -- A Federal Government agency that is charged with supporting the Australian Film Industry.
